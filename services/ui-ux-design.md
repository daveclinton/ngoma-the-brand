## My Approach to Web Development & UI/UX Design

A website is your digital handshake—it needs to impress, connect, and deliver. Every build combines strong development and thoughtful design to create fast, functional, and enjoyable experiences.

### 1. Starting with You
- First, I get clear on your goals, audience, and what makes your brand stand out.  
- No templates. Every decision is tailored to your business.

### 2. Designing for Humans
- **UI (User Interface)**: Clean layouts, strong branding, and visual consistency.  
- **UX (User Experience)**: Intuitive navigation, accessible flows, and user-focused interaction.

### 3. Building with the Best Tools
- Platforms: WordPress, WIX, Webflow, ClickFunnels, Kajabi, Shopify, WooCommerce.  
- Code: HTML, CSS, PHP, and more for full customization.

### 4. Making It Perform
- Optimized for speed, responsiveness, and SEO.  
- Rigorous testing ensures your site works smoothly across devices.
